# NativeMaps

React Native playground with Google Maps.

## TL;DR

```
git clone git@github.com:MathieuDebit/NativeMaps.git
cd NativeMaps
npm install
```

Make sure that React Native for iOS and Android is correctly configured:
- React Native [installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).
- _react-native-maps_ [installation guide](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps/blob/master/docs/installation.md#on-android).

Then `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`.
